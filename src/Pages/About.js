        My name is Ricardo I am 20 years old and I have been programming on and off since 2021. I'm from Ecuador and I'm currently studying engineering in Spain and in my free time I like to do fun projects that come to my mind or solve something that I feel it would be fun to have on my computer. Coding for me is an art form and I believe that the best ability of humans is to create. Since I was a kid I have liked to build new things and I am always looking to innovate in something I like.
